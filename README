The file CDFfit_analysis_R1_code.nb in this repository is for CDF fitting to determine the threshold for incorporation efficiency analysis.

To estimate the incorporation efficiency, follow the code below:
The incorporation efficiency analysis followed the method described by Strauss et al. 
Briefly, Picasso processed localization data of super-resolution images of the patterns using the Picasso pick automatic function. All picks were aligned using the Picasso Average module. 
The aligned picks were then unfolded in the Picasso Render module to get arrays of picks that had been aligned in the same orientation ($https://bit.ly/Incorporation_efficiency_DNA-PAINT_data_and_run_result$). 
Then, it was fed into a Matlab script that analyzes the incorporation efficiency (incorporation_efficiency_analysis_R1_code.m).
Download additional files from $https://bit.ly/Incorporation_efficiency_DNA-PAINT_data_and_run_result$ as an input for the .m files and also the result of the .m file is also provided in that folder.

The instruction above will produce the data presented in Figure 2E row 2 in the main text.
